Istio for service mesh in microservice application with kubernetes deployment 


Istio is an open source service mesh that is designed to help manage microservices in Kubernetes clusters. A service mesh is a layer of infrastructure that provides a way to manage service-to-service communication in a microservices architecture. It is composed of a set of network proxies that are deployed alongside the microservices.

In a microservices architecture, applications are made up of many small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. As the number of services grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage and control the communication between them. This is where a service mesh like Istio comes in.

Istio provides a number of features to help manage microservices in a Kubernetes environment, including:

Traffic management: Istio provides a way to control the flow of traffic between services, including load balancing and routing based on a variety of criteria.
Security: Istio provides a way to secure communication between services using mutual TLS encryption and authentication.
Observability: Istio provides a way to monitor and visualize traffic between services, including metrics and logs.
Resilience: Istio provides a way to handle failures and retries between services.
In summary, Istio is a powerful tool that can help simplify the management of microservices in Kubernetes clusters by providing a comprehensive set of features for traffic management, security, observability, and resilience.
